      title: SURFsara HPC Cloud login procedure changed
      explanation_html: |
        <p>As of 1 October, the login procedure for the SURFsara HPC Cloud has changed: you will now have to authenticate yourself via SURFconext.</p>

        <h2>What do you need to do?</h2>
        <p>You need to migrate your login to make it suitable for the new login method. This is a one-time task and involves the steps below.</p>
        <p>If you have already migrated your HPC Cloud login, you should update your bookmarks to the new login page: <a href="https://oort.hpccloud.surfsara.nl" target="_blank">https://oort.hpccloud.surfsara.nl</a>.</p>
        <p>This is an overview of the steps you have to take for the migration:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>login to SURFconext (see bottom of this page)</li>
          <li>enter the username and password of your existing HPC Cloud login and accept the terms of service</li>
          <li>your login is migrated and the old password can no longer be used</li>
          <li>go to the OpenNebula login page and click 'Login'.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Exceptions</h2>
        <p>If one of these apply to you, please contact an advisor:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you have more than one HPC Cloud login</li>
          <li>you do not have a SURFconect account</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For exceptions and more information about this process can be found in our HPC Cloud documentation.</p>
